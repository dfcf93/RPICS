8 puzzle solver using a star algorithm and a priority queue

As of now all of the test cases work and have decent run times. With ones with possible 25 step solutions the run time drops to about 2 minutes but the 19 and less are around 10 seconds

to run it just use the c++ file using terminal or use the python file in terminal 
all of the sample cases work
